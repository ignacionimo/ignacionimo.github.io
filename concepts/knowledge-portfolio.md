# My Knowledge Portfolio: An Introduction
*Date Started: November 11, 2025*

## Why a Knowledge Portfolio?

I was inspired by **The Pragmatic Programmer** to work on myself by the practice of continuous learning and documentation. I was also motivated to start working on this portfolio, as a current colleague of mine has it's own [Taras's Blog](https://github.com/bunyk/blog). 

This portfolio has several purposes:

* **Learning Reinforcement:** The act of writing down a concept forces a deeper understanding.
* **Quick Reference:** A curated set of solutions, commands, and "gotchas" I can look up quickly.
* **Public Accountability:** Sharing my learning journey helps motivate consistency.

## My tools

* **Source:** Git repository (`https://github.com/ignacionimo/ignacionimo.github.io`)
* **Format:** Pure **Markdown**
* **Editor:** **Vim** (using plugins like `vim-markdown` for a smoother experience)
* **Hosting:** GitHub Pages for simple, static deployment.

## First posts

I would like to document:
* Core concepts from the Pragmatic Programmer book that I find complicated, or interesting enough to expand on.
* Anything that I may encounter on my day-to-day job. Documenting solutions to non-trivial problems.
* New Commands: Shell or language-specific commands I use daily.
* Small projects, to demonstrate understanding of basic concepts like **CRUD** and **RESTful design**.
